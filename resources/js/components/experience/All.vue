                            I began repairing computers as a student assistant at Siena College. 
                            Since then, I've worked as a part-time computer technician, 
                            handling tasks such as computer repairs, installations, and network setup. 
                            Currently, I manage a computer shop and have established two units to kickstart my business.

                            visiting individuals who applied for motorcycle units.

                            After high school, I applied for and received a scholarship at a Catholic school, 
                            marking the beginning of my college journey. Initially, I was assigned to various departments. 
                            Before earning academic credits, I trained for six months in the library department. 
                            After that, I started my first year and moved to the canteen section. 
                            Later, I was transferred to the ICT Department, which aligned with my BS in Computer Science. 
                            Unfortunately, my time at Siena College was cut short when the school had to downsize, 
                            and I was among those affected.
