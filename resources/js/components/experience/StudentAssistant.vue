                    After high school, I applied for and received a scholarship at a Catholic school, 
                    marking the beginning of my college journey. Initially, I was assigned to various departments. 
                    Before earning academic credits, I trained for six months in the library department. 
                    After that, I started my first year and moved to the canteen section. 
                    Later, I was transferred to the ICT Department, which aligned with my BS in Computer Science. 
                    Unfortunately, my time at Siena College was cut short when the school had to downsize, 
                    and I was among those affected.
