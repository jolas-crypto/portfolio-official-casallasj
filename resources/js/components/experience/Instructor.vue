                        As a part-time instructor at OLLTC, I teach IT courses to students from 1st to 4th year.
                        My curriculum covers a wide range of topics, such as programming, and DB management. 
                        I focus on creating an engaging environment where students enhance their tech skills and 
                        apply theory to practice. Alongside teaching, I manage the IT dept., 
                        ensuring smooth operation of tech resources and infrastructure. 
                        This includes maintaining labs, updating software/hardware, 
                        and providing tech support to faculty and students. 
                        My dual role enables me to bridge the gap between education and real-world IT challenges, 
                        preparing students for successful tech careers.
